## Features and Practices Included

### Asynchronous Fetching and Display of Comments
* Implemented an asynchronous mechanism to fetch and display comments in the UICollectionView.
* Utilized UIScrollViewDelegate to detect the scroll position and trigger asynchronous loading when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list.

### Pagination and Dynamic Loading
* Implemented pagination for loading additional comments as the user reaches the end of the list.

### User Interface Enhancement
* Integrated a polished user interface with reusable components such as cells for comments, card views, buttons, and list rows.
* Implemented responsive and adaptive layouts using CollectionView and ScrollView, ensuring smooth transitions and optimal presentation across various screen sizes.

### Efficient JSON Decoding
* Efficiently decoded JSON data from remote URLs using Swift's Codable protocol.
* Utilized URLSession to fetch movie details and comments, ensuring error handling and robustness in data retrieval.

I HAVE TAKEN ALL OF THE IMAGES IN THE APPLICATION FROM VARIOUS WEBSITES ON THE INTERNET AND WITHOUT ANY COMMERCIAL PURPOSE, I AM ONLY INCLUDING THEM IN THE APPLICATION BECAUSE I THINK IT IS A SWIFTUIKIT TRAINING FOR MYSELF AND A GOOD CODING TRAINING FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO BENEFIT FROM IT. I STATE THAT I DO NOT INTEND TO COPY OR REPRODUCE AN EFFORT MADE BY ANY ILLUSTRATOR. FOR CONTACT;
